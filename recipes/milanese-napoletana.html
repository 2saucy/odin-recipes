        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>Milanesa napolitana is a variation on the breaded fried steak called milanesa that is popular in Argentina and Uruguay. Milanesa a la Napolitana does not originate from Milan or Naples; it's thought to have been invented in the 1940s at a Buenos Aires restaurant called “Nápoli”.
        Milanesa napolitana is similar to veal parmesan, but with South American touches. After the steak is breaded and fried, it's topped with a slice of ham, tomato sauce, and melted mozzarella cheese, and served with french fries. Leftovers make great sandwiches, especially when paired with a soft but crusty roll.</p>
